<a name="why-a-blog" class="anchor" href="#why-a-blog"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why a blog?</h1>

<p>Why not? but mostly because i feel its time to give back.
Countless times Ive been trapped in a situation I cant figure out, perhaps because the problem is too deep inside the technology Im using or the architecture in wich im working has artefacts that are not known to me, but somehow, deep inside formums or blogs, there is a contributor that has already overcome that problem, or maybe an expert that can be cetain about what is really happening, and they save my day.
There is no time in real life to be an expert in every aspect of every technology we have to deal with. Taking into account that nowardays the number of new technologies is overwhelming, it comes out natural that we cant master all the knoledge that is around.
Luckily in computer science there has been always a huge community sharing information, knowledge and experience. This titan got our backs when we are in trouble, but we must at some point, give something back.</p>
