Taking into account that nowardays the number of new technologies is overwhelming, it comes out natural that we cant master all the knoledge that is around.\r\nLuckily in computer science there has been always a huge community sharing information, knowledge and experience. This titan got our backs when we are in trouble, but we must at some point, give something back.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
